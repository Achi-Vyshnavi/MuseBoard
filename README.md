# MuseBoard
MuseBoard: Turning creative designs into live apps instantly using AI, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js—built for innovators and creators.
# MuseBoard
MuseBoard is an AI-driven design-to-code platform that empowers designers and developers to turn mockups into production-ready applications instantly. I led the end-to-end frontend architecture, implemented a modular component-driven design, optimized performance, and integrated backend APIs, creating a seamless, responsive, and high-performance user experience.



🌟 Overview:
MuseBoard leverages AI to bridge the gap between design and development. Users can upload designs, and the platform automatically generates clean, maintainable frontend code with live previews. This project demonstrates my expertise in building scalable, polished UIs using React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript, with backend integration via Node.js or FastAPI.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

**Frontend:**  
- React.js & Next.js (for SSR and routing)  
- TypeScript (for type safety)  
- Styled Components / CSS Modules (for modular styling)  
- Performance optimizations: Code-splitting, lazy-loading, memoization  

**Backend:**  
- Node.js / FastAPI (for API endpoints, AI integration)  
- RESTful API architecture  
- Async processing for AI code generation  
- Database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL – placeholder for production setup)  

**Other Tools:**  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Vercel / Render for cloud deployment  
- ESLint & Prettier for code quality  
- CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration  

 🔑 Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Design-to-Code:** Convert Figma or Sketch designs into responsive React components.  
- **Modular Component Architecture:** Reusable UI components for scalable frontend development.  
- **Performance Optimized:** Server-side rendering, code-splitting, and lazy loading.  
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **API Integration:** Backend services handle AI processing and code generation efficiently.  
- **Collaborative Preview:** Real-time live preview for team collaboration.

⚡ Setup (Local Development):

-Frontend-
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

-Backend-
cd backend
# Node.js
npm install
npm start

# FastAPI
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.main:app --reload

📈 Deployment
Frontend: Vercel (Next.js optimized hosting)
Backend: Render / Heroku / AWS Lambda (API endpoints for AI integration)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated tests, linting, and deployment

📝 My Role
Led frontend architecture and built modular React components.
Implemented SSR, responsive UI, and performance optimization.
Integrated AI-powered code generation APIs with the frontend.
Designed scalable folder structure for production-ready deployment.
Ensured clean code standards, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
